<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Powder-Actuated Nail Gun Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Drive Nail Gun</li><li>Indirect Drive Nail Gun</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The powder-actuated nail gun market is primarily divided into two types: direct drive and indirect drive nail guns. Direct drive nail guns utilize a powder charge to propel nails directly into materials, offering high-speed fastening for concrete and steel. Indirect drive nail guns, on the other hand, rely on a piston mechanism where the powder charge drives a piston that then impacts the nail, allowing for adjustable force and reducing the risk of damage to the work surface. Both types are essential in construction and industrial applications.</p></p>
