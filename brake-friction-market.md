<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brake Friction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brake Disc</li><li>Drum Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The brake friction market consists primarily of two types: brake disc and drum brakes. Brake disc systems utilize a flat, circular cast iron or carbon-carbon disc that clamps down with brake pads to provide stopping power, offering better heat dissipation and performance. Conversely, drum brakes operate using a cylindrical drum, where brake shoes press against the inner surface to create friction. While disc brakes are favored for their efficiency and performance in modern vehicles, drum brakes remain prevalent in cost-sensitive segments and certain applications.</p></p>
